vinci bot

# little shoutout
this discord bot has been made with [sern handler](https://sern.dev) and MAN I LOVE THIS HANDLER.

the maintainers helped me out from day one of the bot (and also teached me a lotta js along the way)

so tysm for everything, and I hope I can continue making new bots with this <3

(also, fellow programmer, consider using it please)
